# Hello! This is my first project without a teacher!

#### Im happy to see that you have taken an interest in my project, I really worked hard on it to try and improve my coding skills.

### There is without a doubt, unneccessary code, and most likely, missing code as well. Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated.

## Also! I could not figure out why my form buttons were not as long as the image. I tried figuring it out on my own, but came up with no luck. 

#### Let me know anything that comes across your mind while looking at my code.

## Thank you again!
